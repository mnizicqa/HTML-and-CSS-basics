Ah, ha, ha
Oh-oh, yeah
'Til you work

Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me
Baby, and now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la, la

Somebody tell me, oh
Won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you
Give you money
Work to give you money (oh)

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give-and-take
Well, you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough, then how can it be good enough for two?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
I can't work any harder than I do (la, la, la, la, la)

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la, la

Somebody tell me, oh
Won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you
Give you money (oh)
Work to give you money (oh)

Aw, why do I do the things I do?
Tell you if I knew
My god, I don't even think that I love you (la, la, la, la, la)

Won't you tell me?
Give you money
Work to give you money (oh-ah)

Ah, oh, yeah
Tell me
Tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week?
All the things we sign, and the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together, it's just a matter of time
My situation never changes walking in and out of that door
Like a stranger for the wages
I give you all, you say you want more

And all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign, and the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time

Work, work
Work, work
La, la, la, la, la (just a matter of)

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la, la

Somebody tell me, oh
Won't you tell me? (Somebody)
Why I work so hard for you
Give you money (oh)
Work to give you money (oh)

Somebody tell me, whoa-oh
Won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you
Give you money (oh)
Work to give you money (oh)

Somebody tell me
Won't you tell me? (Oh, please tell me...)
Why I do the things that I do
Give you money
Work to give you money (oh)
